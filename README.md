# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System
The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model using various algorithms like K Neighbours Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifiers and use a medical data set to predict the susceptibility of a person to heart diseases and strokes with as much accuracy as possible. Our aim is to analyse prediction systems for Heart disease using a greater number of input attributes. The system uses medical terms such as Sex, Age, blood pressure, cholesterol like 13 attributes to predict the likelihood of patient getting a Heart disease.
